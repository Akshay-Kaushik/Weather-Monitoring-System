# Weather-Monitoring-System
This project collects data from various sensors such as DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor, Rain Sensor and Light Sensor which are connected the Node MCU(ESP8266). 
The sensor data can be seen in the Adafruit IO Feed and a report of it will be mailed to us by using IFTTT applets.
